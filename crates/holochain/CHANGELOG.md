## Unreleased

### Added

- Using the 3 level PLRU instance cache from latest holochain wasmer `v0.0.72`

## 0.0.101

This version contains breaking changes to the conductor API as well as a major upgrade to the underlying Wasm runtime.

***:exclamation: Performance impact***

The version of wasmer that is used in this holochain release contains bugs in the scoping of wasmer modules vs. instances, such that it blocks the proper release of memory and slows down execution of concurrent Wasm instances. While we were able to at least mitigate these effects and are coordinating with wasmer to find a proper solution as soon as possible.

The severity of these issues increases with cell concurrency, i.e. using multiple cells with the same DNA. Application development with a single conductor and a few cells are expected to work well unless your machine has serious resource restrictions.

### Added

- `InstallAppBundle` command added to admin conductor API. [\#665](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665)
- `DnaSource` in conductor\_api `RegisterDna` call now can take a `DnaBundle` [\#665](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665)

### Removed

- BREAKING:  `InstallAppDnaPayload` in admin conductor API `InstallApp` command now only accepts a hash.  Both properties and path have been removed as per deprecation warning.  Use either `RegisterDna` or `InstallAppBundle` instead. [\#665](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665)
- BREAKING: `DnaSource(Path)` in conductor\_api `RegisterDna` call now must point to `DnaBundle` as created by `hc dna pack` not a `DnaFile` created by `dna_util` [\#665](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/665)

### CHANGED

- Updated to a version of `holochain_wasmer` that includes a migration to wasmer v2+. [\#773](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/773/files), [\#801](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/80), [\#836](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/836)
- Introduced a simple instance cache to mitigate and potentially outweigh the effects of the aforementioned wasmer conditions [\#848](https://github.com/holochain/holochain/pull/848)

## 0.0.100

This is the first version number for the version of Holochain with a refactored state model (you may see references to it as Holochain RSM).

## 0.0.52-alpha2

*Note: Versions 0.0.52-alpha2 and older are belong to previous iterations of the Holochain architecture and are not tracked here.*
